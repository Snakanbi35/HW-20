            <h1 class="display-4">Welcome TO RAAD</h1>
            <p class="lead">Project Description: RAAD is a newly created app that me and other peers came up with. RAAD 
                is a DIY app that allows users to find project instruction at home, it is meant to make finding DIYs 
                easy for users.</p>
            <hr class="my-4">
            <p> During the process we made a Research plan we then follow that back up by making 
                Interview plan and made our interviews. Following that we made surveys and it was from that 
                survey we were able to jump into our User Insight, problem statement. We then discussed our 
                Proto-persona and story board to see how our users find DIYs. We then used our competitor 
                analysis to see what other apps and websites that had an idea like ours were doing, this helped us 
                see how we could make our app more usable for DIY users. Then we begin to make a low-fi proto-
                type.</p>

                    are having trouble completing DIY projects 
                    efficiently. Due to lack of time management, 
                    materials needed, and unclear instructions.

                "How might we help build an app that might resolve the 
                problem of finding everything in one place to complete 
                DIY projects that would help our users feel happy and

              <p class="card-text">This app included a splash screen this was our groups big focus, we wanted to 
                introduce our users into the app the most natural way possible. We included the logo on the first screen and as 
                you can see the log in page opens right up for us giving the user the option to sign-up, log-in, or skip. Like I said 
                earlier the goal in my mind was to get this part of the process out the way early leaving more time for scrolling 
                and looking through the app. </p>
